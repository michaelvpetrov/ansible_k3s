# Suggestions

### PROJECT

- Some what messy due to folder structure
- Need to polish the  Markdown in some of the `.md` files

### README
- Missing __link__ to (files are there,but need to be mentioned in readme)
  - INSTALL.md
  - CONTRIBUTORS.md
  - TASKS.md

### INSTALL SCRIPT

- naming is not clear
- strict config missing
- description mission
- The way script is written, makes it kind of pointless
  - There are no decision making or testing or environment checking, thus consider working on it.

### ANSIBLE

- You are using jinja engine but no variables are used
  - where are variables ?
  - how are they enabled ?
- task require to use binaries, but where are binaries kept ?
